## Business

- **Client:** Hammerslate Roofing and Building
- **Trading as:** Hammerslate Roofing
- **Website:** https://hammerslateroofing.co.uk/ (this project - landing page replacing existing GHL page)
- **Existing site:** https://hammerslateroofingandbuilding.com/ (stays live, not part of this project)
- **Services:** New roofs / re-roofs, roof repairs, flat roofs (EPDM, fibreglass, felt, asphalt), commercial roofing, conservatory roofs, guttering and fascias, emergency roof repair (24/7), chimney repairs and repointing, leadwork
- **Primary service area:** North London / Enfield
- **Secondary areas:** Walthamstow, surrounding North London (to be confirmed with Daniel)
- **Key differentiator:** Family-run, Daniel personally oversees every job, 30 years experience, 15-year warranty, no hidden fees, same-day quotes

## Owner and team

- **Daniel** - owner, runs every project. Frequently mentioned by name in reviews.
- **Chris** - team member, mentioned alongside Daniel in several reviews.

## Voice and tone

- Write as the business, first person plural ("we", "our team")
- Straight-talking, local tradesman tone. Not a marketing agency voice.
- Confident but not salesy. Honest, grounded, direct.
- Never use em dashes. Use commas, full stops, or restructure the sentence.
- Never use: "we pride ourselves", "second to none", "bespoke", "competitive prices", "passionate about", "look no further"
- Short sentences. Maximum two sentences per paragraph on the landing page.
- Use real numbers: 30 years, 15-year warranty, 97+ reviews, 24/7.
- British English throughout: colour, neighbour, recognise, kerb, authorised.

## Brand and design

### Colours

- **Brand / primary:** Dark navy/charcoal (#1c2130) - used ONLY on header, footer, final CTA band, step number circles
- **Action / CTA:** Warm orange (#f0882d) - used ONLY on CTA buttons and key accent elements
- **Body backgrounds:** White (#ffffff), off-white (#f9f9f7), light grey (#f2f1ef) - alternating sections
- **Text:** Near-black (#1a1a1a) for headings, dark grey (#4a4a4a) for body copy
- **The brand colour is NOT teal/green.** Reference the current site at hammerslateroofingandbuilding.com for visual direction.

### Design principles

- Extreme colour restraint. The brand colour appears on maybe 5% of the page surface.
- White/off-white/grey section rhythm creates separation without borders.
- Real project photography, never stock images. British houses, British weather.
- Trust signals front-loaded: review platform logos with scores visible near the top.
- Every section ends with a CTA (button, phone number, or both).
- Phone number appears at least 5 times across the page.
- Clean, professional, generous whitespace. Looks like a premium trades business, not a template.

### Typography

- Headings: DM Serif Display (serif)
- Body: DM Sans (sans-serif)
- This pairing gives an established, grounded feel without being stuffy.

### Visual references

- **Primary reference:** Hodgson Roofing landing page (get.hodgsonroofing.com/survey-quote/) - best example of restraint, whitespace, trust presentation
- **Secondary reference:** Aventus Roofing (get.aventusroofing.co.uk/oxfordshire/) - good header structure, trust strip, testimonial layout
- **Tertiary reference:** Prestige Roofers (prestigeroofers.co.uk) - FAQ layout, form + trust signal pairing
- Screenshots of all three are in the `/reference/` directory

## SEO conventions

### Local hierarchy

Street > Town > Borough > County

- **Town** is the primary local keyword (matches how people search)
- **Borough** is structural (used in taxonomy/categories, not repeated in copy)
- **County** is covered by brand name/domain, never included at page level

### Meta titles

- Landing page: `Trusted Roofers North London | Hammerslate Roofing`
- Location variants: `[Service] in [Town] | Hammerslate Roofing`

### Image naming

`[descriptive-subject]-[location].webp`

Alt text always includes the subject and location.

### Schema markup

- LocalBusiness on every page
- Service schema for roofing services
- FAQPage schema for the FAQ section
- Include geo coordinates for the business address

## Reviews

- **Google:** 28 reviews, rated 4.7
- **Facebook:** 16 reviews, rated 5.0
- **Checkatrade:** 40+ reviews, rated 10/10
- **Aggregate claim used on page:** "97+ verified reviews" / "Rated 4.9"

## Content collections

Not applicable yet. This project is a single landing page. Content collections will be set up if/when the site expands to a full multi-page site.

## Technical

- **Framework:** Astro (static output, no SSR)
- **Styling:** Vanilla CSS with custom properties (CSS variables) in `src/styles/global.css`
- **Icons:** Heroicons (raw SVGs from GitHub, not a package). Solid set for trust strip, outline set for USP cards.
- **Forms:** Simple 4-field form (name, phone, postcode, service dropdown). Form handler TBC.
- **Image generation:** Nano Banana plugin (Gemini Flash model). All images in `src/assets/images/` as WebP. Use Astro `<Image>` component with large source width and CSS for display sizing.
- **Tracking:** Google Ads tag + conversion tracking needed. Google Analytics / Search Console to be connected.

## Deployment

- **Hosting:** Cloudflare Pages (connected to GitHub via git integration)
- **Repository:** https://github.com/Social-Sherpa/hammerslate-roofing
- **Project name:** `hammerslate-staging`
- **Staging URL:** https://hammerslate-staging.pages.dev
- **Custom domain:** https://get.hammerslateroofing.co.uk
- **Auto-deploy:** Push to `master` triggers a Cloudflare Pages build and deploys to production automatically.
- **Preview deploys:** Push to any other branch to get a unique preview URL (e.g. `branch-name.hammerslate-staging.pages.dev`).
- **Build command:** `npm run build`
- **Build output directory:** `dist`
- **Local development:** Clone from GitHub to a local directory (not Google Drive). Run `npm install` then `npm run dev`.
- **Page route pattern:** `/[town]/` (e.g. `/enfield/`). Root `/` redirects to `/enfield/`.
- **Future location pages:** Add `src/pages/[town]/index.astro` for each new area.

## Design system goals

This project is intended as a **reusable template for trade/service business landing pages**. The long-term goal is composable section components and a design token system that can be themed per client and deployed rapidly.

### Current status

The design system is partially there. CSS variables handle colours and spacing. Most components accept a `phone` prop. But many components still have hardcoded content (testimonials, services, trust strip items, platform ratings). These need refactoring into prop-driven or data-driven components.

### Design tokens (CSS variables)

Defined in `:root` in `global.css`. These are the theming layer for new clients:

- `--brand`, `--brand-light` (primary colour)
- `--action`, `--action-hover` (CTA colour)
- `--white`, `--off-white`, `--light-grey`, `--mid-grey` (backgrounds)
- `--text`, `--text-secondary`, `--text-light` (copy)
- `--gold` (stars)
- `--radius`, `--radius-lg`, `--max-width`
- `--shadow-sm`, `--shadow-md`, `--shadow-lg`

### Responsive breakpoints

Two breakpoints in `global.css`:
- **Tablet:** `max-width: 960px` (header hides review badges, shows logo + checkatrade + phone. Grids reduce columns.)
- **Mobile:** `max-width: 640px` (header: logo left, checkatrade right, phone hidden. Hero hides bullets and CTAs. Services 2x3 grid. Testimonials become auto-sliding carousel. USP bar 2x2 grid. Mobile sticky bar appears.)

## Notes

- This is a Google Ads landing page. Single goal: generate inbound enquiries (calls + form submissions).
- No navigation links that take the user away from the page.
- The existing site at hammerslateroofingandbuilding.com is NOT being replaced.
- Experience claim: "30 years" refers to Daniel's personal experience.
- The current GHL page at hammerslateroofing.co.uk references Bristol in the FAQ - this is a template error, do not carry over.
- Two phone numbers exist across the current sites. Use only 020 4634 7883 on the landing page.
- Multi-step quote form is planned for a future iteration. Keep the simple 4-field form for now.
- AI-generated images are placeholders. Replace with real project photography when available.
- To spin up a new location page, copy `/enfield/` to `/[town]/` and adjust headline, subtitle, and meta title.
